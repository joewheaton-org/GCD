#### Noted Issue for Internet Explorer Users

When downloading the .esriAddIn file, some users have experienced an issue with the file extension being automatically changed to .zip when it is saved to their computer. If you extract the zip contents this will not allow the GCD Add-In to install correctly. To fix this issue:

- **Simply change the .zip extension to .esriAddIn before extracting the contents of the file**
- After the file extension has been changed accordingly you can double click the` .esriAddIn `file to correctly install the GCD Add-In

### Uninstall Procedure

To uninstall an AddIn, you simply go to the Customize -> Add In Manager command in ArcMap and uninstall. The video illustrates this:

#### GCD Compatibility

GCD 6 is an ArcGIS Add-In and no longer requires an installer and administrative privileges to install it. It will still be version specific unfortunately. GCD 6 has been tested for ArcGIS 10.0 and 10.1, and 10.2

GCD 5 is an ArcGIS Plug-In and is therefore, unfortunately, version specific to ArcGIS. The list below shows which releases are compatible
