The GCD 5.0 builds off the core backbone of [GCD 4.0](http://gcd.joewheaton.org/downloads/older-versions/gcd-4-0), but with a completely redesigned user interface and expanded functionality. A plugin to ArcGIS 10 is available, but a stand-alone version is no longer offered (as much of the increased functionality leverages ArcObjects).

### Feature Request

If you have a feature request, please post it here. [Queries](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/contact) from individuals wanting to invest in the GCD Software Development Effort are always welcome.

### Documentation

The software is reasonably self-explanatory to use, but there is help documentation and tutorials available.
